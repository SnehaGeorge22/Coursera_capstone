    "The basis of this study is to help a small group of investors planning to open their first U.S. based brewery / restaurant expansion in Chicago , Illnois. Being that Chicago is the most populated city in US , and continually ranks as an important global city based on a high quality of living, the choice to expand into the neighbor of the  market was an easy selection for the investing group. However, with limited knowledge of the Chicago market, the group of investors have selected us to assist in the selection of which areas of Chicago will facilitate a launch of their brewery / restaurant expansion."
